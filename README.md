A spell-checker using a hashing function and hash tables

This was a mini-project to figure out such concepts as memory allocation, hash tables, and hash functions in C.

I used a polynomial hash function to calculate the value of each word, and then placed these values into a hash table.

From there, I implemented a lookup function to see if words with the same value matched or not.
